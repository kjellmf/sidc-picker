# Military symbol identification code picker

See live demo at https://kjellmf.github.io/sidc-picker/#/

A MILSTD 2525/APP6 symbol identification code picker experiment. Based on a previous project https://github.com/kjellmf/military-symbology-explorer. Also inspired by [Måns Beckman's](https://spatialillusions.com/) [unit symbol generator](https://spatialillusions.com/unitgenerator/).

Thanks to [Måns Beckman](https://spatialillusions.com/) for creating the fantastic [milsymbol](https://spatialillusions.com/milsymbol/index.html) and [milstd](https://spatialillusions.com/milsymbol/index.html) libraries!
